# Receipt Processor Challenge Maaz

 This API provides functionality to process receipts, calculate points based on specific rules, and retrieve health status. 

 ## Features

- **POST /receipts/process**: Process a receipt by validating and storing it with a unique ID.
- **GET /receipts/:id/points**: Retrieve points for a specific receipt.
- **GET /receipts/health**: Check API health status.

## Project Structure

- **handlers.go**: Defines HTTP handlers for receipt processing, point calculation, and health check.
- **main.go**: Sets up routes and starts the server.
- **models.go**: Contains data models (`Item`, `Receipt`).
- **utils.go**: Contains helper functions for receipt validation, points calculation, and formatting.
- **Dockerfile**: Used for containerizing the application.

## Prerequisites

- **Go**: version 1.20+
- **Docker** (optional): If running the application in a Docker container.
